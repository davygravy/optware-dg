This of fork of Optware focuses on some fixes to allow AirPrint and 
Google Cloud Print servers to run natively on Broadcom routers flashed with
TomatoUSB and DD-WRT.  Some of it is based on previous work, but a few 
pieces are bug fixes (such as in the cloudprint.py python script) and/or 
special addistions to make things more towards "install and go".

New optware packages in make/ :
py26-cups
py26-daemon
py26-lockfile
py26-cloudprint
cups
dbus
